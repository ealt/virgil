      "body": "Diff-based walkthroughs allow you to show code changes between two points in time. When viewing a diff step, you'll see a 3-way toggle:\n\n- **Diff**: Shows VS Code's built-in diff editor comparing base and head\n- **Head**: Shows the current (new) code with green highlights\n- **Base**: Shows the old code with red highlights\n\nThis is useful for code reviews, explaining refactors, or documenting how a feature evolved.\n\n**Key concepts:**\n\n- `baseCommit` in the frontmatter specifies the \"before\" state\n- Steps with only `location` show head code (blue highlights)\n- Steps with both `location` and `base_location` enable the 3-way toggle\n- Steps with neither show as informational (no code view)"

This flexibility allows walkthroughs to work in different contexts (local development, CI, PR reviews).",

Resolves base commit using `DiffResolver`\n3. Handles each step type differently:\n   - **diff**: Shows 3-way toggle, opens diff/head/base based on `currentViewMode`\n   - **point-in-time**: Opens file with blue highlights (unchanged behavior)\n   - **base-only**: Opens base file with red highlights\n   - **informational**: Shows panel only, no file opened\n\n**New helper functions:**\n- `showFile()` - Opens a file at a specific commit with colored highlights\n- `showDiff()` - Opens VS Code's diff editor for two commits\n\n**View mode command:** `virgil.setViewMode` allows the toggle buttons to switch views without changing steps.",
