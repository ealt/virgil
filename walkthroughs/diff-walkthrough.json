      "body": "Diff-based walkthroughs allow you to show code changes between two points in time. When viewing a diff step, you'll see a 3-way toggle:\n\n- **Diff**: Shows VS Code's built-in diff editor comparing base and head\n- **Head**: Shows the current (new) code with diff head highlights (configurable, default: green)\n- **Base**: Shows the old code with diff base highlights (configurable, default: red)\n\nThis is useful for code reviews, explaining refactors, or documenting how a feature evolved.\n\n**Key concepts:**\n\n- `repository.baseCommit` specifies the \"before\" state\n- Steps with only `location` show head code with `standard` highlights (configurable)\n- Steps with both `location` and `base_location` enable the 3-way toggle\n- Steps with neither show as informational (no code view)"

See `src/types.ts` around lines 202-276 for the view mode and step type definitions.\n\n**ViewMode** defines the three possible views:\n\n- `'diff'` - Side-by-side comparison\n- `'head'` - Current/new code only\n- `'base'` - Previous/old code only\n\n**StepType** categorizes steps based on their location fields:\n\n- `'diff'` - Has both `location` and `base_location`\n- `'point-in-time'` - Has only `location` (traditional walkthrough)\n- `'base-only'` - Has only `base_location` (rare, for deleted code)\n- `'informational'` - Has neither (text-only step)\n\nThe `getStepType()` function determines the type from a step's fields.",
